## FAQ
- **Why its called 'Shortwave'?**

    Shortwave signals have a very long range because of their very good reflection properties. 
Due to their long range, they can be received almost anywhere in the world. 
The same applies to Internet radio stations, which can also be received almost anywhere in the world.
That's why we decided to call the project 'Shortwave', because internet radio stations and shortwave radio stations share many characteristics.

- **Why I cannot edit stations anymore?**

    The edit feature is disabled because of vandalism. I cannot change this. [More information here](http://www.radio-browser.info/gui/#/) and [here](https://github.com/segler-alex/radiobrowser-api/issues/39)

- **Will Shortwave compatible with the Librem 5?**

    Yes! We use the awesome [libhandy](https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy) library to make the interface adaptive.

- **Which database does Shortwave use?**

    [radio-browser.info](http://www.radio-browser.info/gui/#/). It's a community database. Everybody can add/edit information.

- **Where I can find the old Gradio source code?**

    The old Gradio Vala source code is still available in the [gradio-old](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Shortwave/tree/gradio-old) branch.
